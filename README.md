Designed to test the RESTful APIs using the Service Layer Pattern.
This is a Playwright API framework written in Java and using TestNG as the testing framework, with Maven as the build automation tool. The framework's structure is as follows:

* **src/main/resources**:This folder contains config.dev.properties and config.prod.properties files for configuration purposes.<br>

In addition, there is a Test folder which contains:
* **src/test/java**: This folder contains the test classes with test methods.<br>
